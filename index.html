    <!-- SKILLS Section -->
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        As a student, I have been working on building a variety of skills that not only help me in my academic life but also in my personal development. One of the skills I’ve been focusing on is problem-solving. Whether it's tackling complex assignments or projects, I love the challenge of breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. This skill has proven to be valuable both in and outside of the classroom. Additionally, I’ve developed my editing skills. I spend time working on essays, research papers, and presentations, making sure that my work is clear, well-structured, and visually engaging. Editing is something I value because it helps me improve my own work while refining my attention to detail.
        
        Another skill that I am passionate about is cooking. It started as a hobby, but over time, I’ve realized that it also helps me unwind and take my mind off of school stress. Cooking has taught me patience, organization, and creativity—skills that can be applied to many aspects of life, including my studies. Moreover, I’ve started to explore light programming. While I’m still learning, I’ve found that coding with languages like HTML, CSS, and Python is a useful way to build my problem-solving abilities while working on small projects.

    <!-- HOBBIES Section -->
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In my free time as a student, I make sure to engage in hobbies that help me relax and recharge. Watching movies is one of my favorite ways to escape from the pressures of schoolwork. I love exploring different genres and discovering new films that provide both entertainment and inspiration. Playing video games is another hobby I enjoy. It’s not just a fun pastime; gaming also challenges me strategically and allows me to unwind with friends, especially in multiplayer games. It's a great way to connect with others while honing my teamwork and decision-making skills.
        
        I also make time to go outdoors whenever I can. Whether it’s going to my friends, spending time with my family, or simply taking a walk outside, being in nature gives me a break from the academic grind and helps me clear my mind. It's also a great way to get some exercise and boost my mood. I enjoy attending social events with friends and family as well. These moments of connection are important for maintaining a healthy school-life balance and fostering meaningful relationships that support me throughout my student journey.

    <!-- INTERESTS Section -->
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        My interests reflect my curiosity about the world and my desire to learn in a variety of areas. One of my main interests is music. I love listening to different genres, from classical to contemporary, and I find that music is a great companion for studying and relaxing. I’m also fascinated by the process of sound production, which has inspired me to explore music production. I’ve started experimenting with thinking on creating my own music, and this helps me think outside the box and enhances my creativity.

        Reading is another interest I’m passionate about. I’ve always enjoyed reading books—whether they’re fiction or non-fiction. Books have a special way of broadening my perspective and helping me learn new things, both for school and personal growth. I like to read on a variety of topics, from self-improvement to technology, which allows me to stay informed and continuously evolve as a student. 

        Technology also excites me, and I’m particularly interested in the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things. As a student, I am always eager to stay up to date with new trends in tech, and I look for ways to apply technology to improve my studies or explore new hobbies. My interest in tech is something I plan to pursue further as I continue my education, possibly even incorporating it into my future career.
